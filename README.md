# Object-Oriented-Programming

This folder contains a run file, a main file and a usage report for Large Language Models. The run file calls the code in the main file, just as explained in the assigment. The main file contains the code, and uses classes and functions to guide the initial input through the network of enzymes. The Large Language Model report explains how we used LLMs in this assignment.
